Follow through
Make your dreams come true
Don't give up the fight
You will be alright, ‘cause there's no one like you in the universe

Don't be afraid of what your mind conceives
You should make a stand
Stand for what you believe
And tonight we can truly say
Together we're invincible

During the struggle they will pull us down
But please, please, let's use this chance to turn things around
And tonight we can truly say together we're invincible

What you leave behind
What you choose to be
And whatever they say, your soul's unbreakable

Just break the silence, show me it's real
Wasting our last chance to come away
Just break the silence cause I'm drifting away
Away from you

These blockades must fall
Fight for your life
You've been summoned now

She had something to confess to
But you don't have the time so look the other way
You will wait until it's over to reveal what you'd never shown her
Too little to much to late

Can you see that I am needing, begging for so much more that you could ever give?

She burns like the sun and I can't look away

But in all chaos there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break

No-one round here's good at keeping their eyes closed

We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain, "Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

The people are talking, people are talking
Let 'em talk

I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
I hope you find some paradise

Think you can stop what we do? I doubt it
We've got the energy we tell you all about it
I searched from my spark and I found it

Oh well, the devil makes us sin
But we like it when we are spinning in his grip
Love is like a sin, my love, for the one that feels it the most

And I've seen your loving, mine is gone
And I've been in trouble

Paradise comes at a price that I am not prepared to pay
Take off your disguise, I know that underneath is me

What are they for? They grow up and break up the rules you loved

And the truth's unwinding
Scraping away at my mind
Please stop asking me to describe

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine

I want 'em back
The minds we had

We'll laugh until our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough

Play along
Make-believe it's hyper-real

Aún así insisto en recalcarte lo que contigo aprendí
Que reyes habra muchos pero siempre tienes que ir a ti
Y corazón tucún-tucún-tucún

I'm gonna be the story we believed in silence
The rising and the fall, like nobody before
But I get comfortable 'til I profess my youth to nothing
I'm running from the floor

But if do
She tells me to believe I beg of you
I'm trying to
She tells me that the world is up to you
And if I knew this love will do

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

Tears flow but why I am crying?
After all, I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

And though the end is near, I'm not sorry
Catch my soul ‘cause it's willing to fly away
Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone I've gone beyond to seek the truth
When you know that your time is close at hand maybe then you'll begin to understand life down here is just a strange illusion

I should have known this from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life, but love can break your heart

Say, it'll make you insane and I'm bending the truth
You are to blame for all this life you'll lose

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today

Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, facing a bit of the truth, the truth

Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it

Dragonflies out in the Sun
You know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies are all having fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when the day is done

And this old world is a new world and a bold world for me

I think our lives have just begun
I'll feel my soul crumbling away
And falling away with you

Staying awake to chase a dream
Tasting the air you're breathing in
I know I won't forget a thing

Promise to hold you close and pray
Watching the fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same

I can't remember when it was good
Moments of happiness elude

And all of the love we threw away
And all of the hopes we've cherished fade

All of the love we left behind
Watching the flashbacks intertwine
Memories I will never find

I wanna play the game
I want the friction
You will be the death of me

You're something beautiful
A contradiction

I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it

You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
How did it come to this?

Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die

The truth is that when I am killing in order to survive
I'm always seeking to live and die on the edge
Life is a broken simulation, I'm unable to feel
I'm searching for something that's real
I'm always seeking to see what's behind the veil

Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake

Luck ain't even lucky gotta make your own breaks

Won't stand down, I'm growing stronger

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, don't back down

You must find a way
Dig down and find fate

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical

In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

Brain cleansed, fractured identity
Fragments and scattered debris

Fall down, learn when to count it out
Withdraw before you're out of time
A clean slate and buried war crimes

You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs

Doubts will try break you
Unleash you heart and soul
Trouble will surround you
Start taking some control
Stand up and delivery your wildest fantasy
Do the fuck you want to there's no one to appease

One, two, three, four, fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination

Get up and commit
Show the power trapped within
Stand up and begin

Race, life's a race
And I'm gonna win
Yes I'm gonna win

And I'll light the fuse
And I'll never lose
And I choose to survive
Whatever it takes

You won't pull ahead
I'll keep up the pace
And I'll reveal my strength
To the whole human race

Yes I am prepared to stay alive
I won't forgive
And I won't give in
Because I choose to thrive
Yes, I'm gonna win!

And I choose to survive
So I told you, you were warned, didn't listen

Free me from this world
It was a mistake imprisoning my soul
Don't give in, hear the engines roar
Running around in circles feeling caged by endless rules
Can you free me?

Are you fine?
Have you found a way to escape?

We still hope
But our dreams are not the same
Hear me
What words just can't convey
Don't let the sun in your heart decay

No religion or mind virus
Is there a hope that the facts will ever find us?

No chance for fate

We're not droplets in the ocean

I want the truth

Don't let the magic leave us

Aping my soul
You stole my overture
Trapped in God's program
I can't escape

Who are we?
Where are we?
When are we?
Why are we?
Where are we?
Why, why, why?
Why are we in here?

Spread our codes to the stars
You must rescue us all

Tell us your final wish
Now we know we know you can never return
Tell us your final wish
We will tell it to the world

Let's start over again
Why can't we start it over again?
Just let us start it over again
And we'll become, this time we'll get it right
It's our last chance to forgive ourselves

Amor fati

I won't stand in your way
Let your hatred grow
And she'll scream, and she'll shout, and shel'll pray
And she had a name

And I won't hold you back
Let your anger rise
And we'll fly, and we'll fall, and we'll burn

This is the last time I'll abandon you
And this is the last time I'll forget you
I wish I could

Look to the starts
Let hope burn in your eyes

I wish I could

I'm endlessly caving in and turning inside out
It's holding me, morphing me and forcing me to strive

And dreaming I'm alive

I'm not breaking down, I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control

Feeling my faith erode

Blue skies

Don't kid yourself and don't fool yourself
Don't grow up too fast and don't embrace the past

This life's too good to last
This life could be the last and we're too young to see

I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you every seen do it

The clock's ticking, I just count the hours

Reality is catching up with me taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody

Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go

Change everything you are and everything you were
Your number has been called
Fights and battles have begun

Your hard times are ahead, you've got to be the best
And use this chance to be heard
Your time is now

Don't let yourself down
Don't let yourself go
Your last chance has arrived

So I'll love whatever you become and forget the reckless things we've done

A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you my beautiful
Sing for absolution, I will be singing, and falling from your grace

Declare this an emergency
Come on and spread a sense of urgency

You're so happy now, burning the candle at both ends

Breathe in deep

Future self forgive this mess you waste 20 years and wind up alone and demented

It's like we're going through the motions of a scripted destiny
Tell me where's our inspiration?
If life won't wait, I guess it's up to me

Won't look back when I say goodbye
Gonna leave this world behind me
Gonna take what's mine tonight

Every wasted day becomes a wasted canche you're gonna wake up feeling sorry ‘cause life won't wait

Leave the past in the past, gonna find the future
If misery loves company, well so long, you'll miss me when I'm gone

Life it's what happens while you're busy making your excuses
Another day, another casualty, but that won't happen to me

It's not the secrets of the government that's keeping' you dumb.
It's the other way around, wait, what's that sound?
One by one, baby, here they come
The end has no end

I'm sick of this town, sick of my job, sick of my friends ‘cause everyone's jaded, sick of this place, I wanna break free, I'm so frustrated, I just wanna jump

And I've been told
We're all too old

Oh guess who died today
Just another aspiring actor
But he wished his life away
A warning fracture

I've seen the signs I'm past that stage, life and times, day and age

I don't wanna wake up one day and find out it's too late, to do all the things I wanna do

If you are alive
I know you ain't reach your best yet
You could see more, you could be more, alright?

You should feel invisible, powerful, strong

You thinking of negative stuff
You talking negativity
You in that negative zone

The one thing you need to do
To go where you've never gone before
Is to change the way you think
Where your focus goes, your energy flows, are you hearing me?

Welcome and entertain them all! even if they're a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in.
Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.

Dream beyond dreams
Beyond life you will find your song
Close your eyes and rise higher still, endless thrill

You are my angel com from way above to bring me love
Her eyes, she's on the dark side.
Neutralize every man in sight.
I love you, I love you, I love you

You are the night, you are the ocean
You are the light behind a cloud
You are the end and the beginning

There's no such thing as competition
To find our way, we lose control

Remember love's our only mission
This is a journey of the soul

Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams

Even, after, work is over
Work it, make it, do it, make us
Harder, better, faster, stronger

One more time we're gonna celebrate
Don't stop the dancin'
Don't wait too late

It was almost impossible because the dream was so big
And I didn't have any idea what to do
Once you free your mind about a concept
You can do whatever you want
So, nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do

Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
Where are the locks to try the key?

Around the world

Is in the house, yeah

Buy it, use it, break it, fix it, trash it, change it, mail, upgrade it

We are human after all

In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from

Touch the divine

Happy life with your machines scattered around the room

I was just guessing at number and figures pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress do not speak as loud as my heart

Just give me a life to bleed another world outside that's full of all the awful things that I made ‘cause we are the last disease

Rippin' through like a missile
Rippin' through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon

How does it feel now, to watch it burn?

Take all you need and I'll compensate your greed with broken hearts

I weigh the water I feel it all, I ask myself a million questions in the dark
I lay in silence but silence talks, it tells me heaven is no closer than it was

Everything that I've been mixin', all mixed up inside

You take the sane in me and tear it like a page

I'm so ugly, that's okay, so are you, broke our mirrors

I like it
I'm not gonna crack
I miss you
I'm not gonna crack
I love you
I'm not gonna crack

I'm worse at what I do best and for this gift I feel blessed

It's okay to eat fish ‘cause they don't have any feelings

Moral code update three times a year
I'll never ask for forgiveness
I come with God as my witness
I pray he'll wash my hands

Rapacity will be the illness that we will learn to love

You're animal, don't take anything less
We're animals, we're out of control

Are you worth your weight in gold?
Going once, going twice, sold! It's all about that cold hard cash, hon

Aren't you lonely?
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough
Happily numb

Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
So comfortable we cannot see the trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on and party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song, dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Keep it on repeat, stumbling around like a wasted zombie
We think we're free, drink this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat?
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can

Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
I beg and plead
Am I a part of the cure or am I a part of the disease?

Why can't we see that when we bleed we bleed the same

We the people make the world look how it's going down
So we walk into our lives no one look deep in the eyes
Except you, take my smile, that's the only thing I have

Hope you're fine
Hope you're great
Hope you're not alone in this town
Hope you have good friends to talk
Hope you will soon find a job, now you smile right back at me you see that's what I need

Your mind is a wonder
Your heart is so full of love
Don't you waste it

Look to tomorrow
The end of our sorrows
Our world could be so full of joy
Don't you waste it	

She runs with hell, she destroys me with her eyes closed

You walk in beauty like the night of cloudless climbs and starry skies
‘Cause I can see God in your eyes and all that's best of dark and bright

It could be wrong but it should've been right to let our hearts ignite

If we live a life in fear I'll wait a thousand years just to see you smile again

From alpha to delta, through fury and pain

Close your eyes, clear your heart, cut the cord, are we human or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye
Wish me well
You've gotta let me go

They promised so much

How much pain has cracked your soul?
How much love would make you whole?
You're my guiding lighting strike

I can't find the words to say
They're overdue
I assure you my debts are real

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

I will be chasing a starlight until the end of my life
I don't know if it's worth it anymore
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite all the souls that would die just to feel alive

I'll never let you go if you promise not to fade away

This is the part mental stability meets talent

Carnal, si yo tengo a mi chamán que me protege del mal
De la envidia y de la vibra que me tiran los demás
Al ganar vas a notar que te sobran enemigos
Que te quieren ver jodido sin ni haberte conocido
Ese Babo como amigo, neta es más recomendable
Porque tenerlo de contra suele ser desagradable
Es un hijo de su madre que nació pa' hacer desmadre
Lo corrieron de la secu' pa' en la tarde

Hey teacher tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the sould and rebuild the energy?

Rhythm, you have it or you don't. That's a fallacy

I'm a trendsetter, league of my own it don't get better, read what I wrote I'm a best seller

Reach for my goals hit it dead center

Trendsetter, told 'em before but they don't listen

I keep it goin', flowin' over this, I make it look easy. Easy for me to say, I do this every day of the week

I'm a scene-stealer, seat-filler, blow up the numbers

And I ain't leaving no crumbs so you know when I'm done with it

I'm down to earth, like the ground floor
But I been fly so long, I tend to ask people, "What's the ground for?"
Man, I'm only headed up

I'm a new school vibe with an old soul

Feeling so tall I could give a high five to the pilot

Blindfold on me I still got the most vision

I got the bag I'm back just to double it

It's my birthday
NO IT'S NOT
But I still look good though

I got a plan
I know the direction
The lay of the land
I know the score like the back of my hand
Them other boys
I don't give a damn

Nothing can break me down

I got gas in the tank

Never stand still that's the motto

Fit a week worth of work in a minute, machine well oiled you know how I stay efficient, To-do list written, I do this different

We making it cause we making moves

Mi historia no es agradable, no es suave y armoniosa como las historias inventadas; sabe a insensatez y a confusión, a locura y a ensueño, como la vida de todos los hombres que no quieren más mentirse a sí mismos.

Podemos comprendernos unos a otros, pero sólo a sí mismo puede interpretarse cada uno.

La gente dijo que aquellos tipos con la "señal" eran siniestros; y la verdad, lo eran.

Por «casualidad», como suele decirse. Pero esas casualidades no existen. Cuando alguien necesita algo con mucha urgencia y lo encuentra, no es la casualidad la que se lo proporciona, sino él mismo. El propio deseo y la propia necesidad conducen a ello.

—¡Casualidad! ¡No diga estupideces, muchacho! ¡No se llega por casualidad a conocer a Abraxas, para que se entere! Yo le contaré más cosas sobre él. Yo sé algo de él.

—Muchacho—dijo con vehemencia—, también usted celebra misterios. Sé que tiene usted sueños de los que nada me dice. No los quiero conocer. Pero le digo una cosa: ¡vívalos todos, viva esos sueños, eríjales altares! No es lo perfecto, pero es un camino. ¡No los tema! ¡Son lo mejor que posee! Créame. Yo he perdido mucho por haber amordazado mis sueños cuando tenía su edad. Eso no debe hacerse. Cuando se conoce a Abraxas, ya no se debe hacer. No hay que temer nada ni creer ilícito nada de lo que nos pide el alma.

Lo que no está dentro de nosotros mismos no nos inquieta.

Descubrí el gusto de la muerte; y la muerte sabe amarga porque es nacimiento, porque es miedo e incertidumbre ante una aterradora renovación.

—Las cosas que vemos —dijo Pistorius con voz apagada— son las mismas cosas que llevamos en nosotros. No hay más realidad que la que tenemos dentro. Por eso la mayoría de los seres humanos vive tan irrealmente; porque cree que las imágenes exteriores son la realidad y no permiten a su propio mundo interior manifestarse. Se puede ser muy feliz así, desde luego. Pero cuando se conoce lo otro, ya no se puede elegir el camino de la mayoría. Sinclair, el camino de la mayoría es fácil, el nuestro difícil.

En estos momentos tuve una certeza fulminante: cada uno tenía una «misión», pero ésta no podía ser elegida, definida, administrada a voluntad. Era un error desear nuevos dioses, y completamente falso querer dar algo al mundo. No existía ningún deber, ninguno, para un hombre consciente, excepto el de buscarse a sí mismo, afirmarse en su interior, tantear un camino hacia adelante sin preocuparse de la meta a que pudiera conducir.

Tales cosas sólo podían surgir marginalmente. La misión verdadera de cada uno era llegar a sí mismo. Se podía llegar a poeta o a loco, a profeta o a criminal; eso no era asunto de uno: a fin de cuentas, carecía de toda importancia. Lo que importaba era encontrar su propio destino, no un destino cualquiera, y vivirlo por completo. Todo lo demás eran medianías, un intento de evasión, de buscar refugio en el ideal de la masa; era amoldarse; era miedo ante la propia individualidad.

Yo era un proyecto de la naturaleza, un proyecto hacia lo desconocido, quizá hacia lo nuevo, quizá hacia la nada; y mi misión, mi única misión, era dejar realizarse este proyecto que brotaba de las profundidades, sentir en mí su voluntad e identificarme con él por completo.

Eso es mi punto débil. Porque a veces, Sinclair, sé que no debía tener esos deseos, que son un lujo y una debilidad. Sería más grande y más justo si me ofreciera al destino sin ambiciones. Pero soy incapaz; es lo único que no puedo hacer. Quizá usted pueda hacerlo un día. Es muy difícil; es lo único verdaderamente difícil que existe, muchacho.

Para nosotros, en cambio, la humanidad era un futuro lejano hacia el que todos nos movíamos, cuya imagen nadie conocía, cuyas leyes no estaban escritas en ninguna parte.

— No debe usted entregarse a deseos en los que no cree. Sé lo que desea. Pero tiene que saber renunciar a esos deseos o desearlos de verdad. Cuando llegue a pedir con la plena seguridad de que su deseo va a ser cumplido, éste será satisfecho. Sin embargo, usted desea y al mismo tiempo se arrepiente de ello con miedo. Hay que superar eso.

Will you hold the line when every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me

In this house of mine nothing every comes without a consquence or cost

Well, I met an old man dyin' on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
Never let your fear decide your fate

I say you kill your heroes and fly

And in my dreams, all I see is you
All I wanna feel, is free with you
Are you real, am I living the truth?

You got this light in your eyes
This fire that get me hypnotized
And I can't walk away from you

The soul of each of us is given a unique daimon before we are born, and it has selected an image or pattern that we live on earth. The daimon remembers what is in your image and belongs to your pattern, and therefore the daimon is the carrier of your destiny.

A calling may be postponed, avoided, intermittently missed. It may also possess you completely. Whatever; eventually it will out. It makes its claim. The daimon does not go away.

I was born to run, I was born for this
Run me like a race horse
Break me down and build me up
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains

I can feel a new life I always knew life can be dangerous

Fell on  my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick

But even a small lighter can burn a bridge

With all disrespect, let me say this

I'ma break out and then hide every lock

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Feel weak, and when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Moral failure lies dormant within all human beings. Every human being probably has the potential for evil in them. Moral failure can happen in all social classes; it can affect the chairperson of a large bank just as much as a homeless person. When the ruling classes of countries fail to build fair social structures, people will eventually rebel and take their share of tangible goods through strikes, theft, human trafficking, murder and drugs. As a result, social capital is damaged and society is getting sick. Disease is a term that cannot just be limited to the human body; it is a system concept as well. There also sick families, sick companies and sick societies.

What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods

Ever since I could remember, I'd wished I'd been lucky enough to be alive at a great time when something big was going on, like a crucifixion. And suddenly I realized I was

Yet among all the distractions and diversions of a planet which now seemed well on the way to becoming one vast playground, there were some who still found time to repeat an ancient and never-answered question: Where do we go from here?

The world's now placid, featureless, and culturally dead: nothing really new has been created since the Overlords came.
The reason's obvious. There's nothing left to struggle for, and there are too many distractions and entertainments.
Do you realize that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out over the various channels?
No wonder that people are becoming passive sponges – absorbing but never creating.
Did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day?
Soon people won't be living their own lives any more.
It will be a full-time job keeping up with the various family serials on TV!

As you doubtless know, Sir,
one of the great problems of our culture has been the dichotomy between art and science.
Do you subscribe to the view that all artists are abnormal?
That their work – or at any rate the impulse behind it –
is the result of some deep-seated psychological dissatisfaction?
I've been told that all men are artists to a certain extent,
so that everyone is capable of creating something, if only on a rudimentary level.
At your schools yesterday, for example, I noticed the emphasis placed on
self-expression in drawing, painting, and modeling.
The impulse seemed quite universal,
even among those clearly destined to be specialists in science.
So if all artists are abnormal, and all men are artists, we have an interesting syllogism...

As to the nature of that change, we can tell you very little.
We do not know how it is produced – what trigger impulse the Overmind employs when it judges
that the time is ripe.
All we have discovered is that it starts with a single individual – always a child –
and then spreads explosively, like the formation of crystals round the first nucleus in a saturated solution.
Adults will not be affected, for their minds are already set in an unalterable mold.

In a few years, it will all be over, and the human race will have divided in twain.
There is no way back, and no future for the world you know.
All the hopes and dreams of your race are ended now.
You have given birth to your successors,
and it is your tragedy that you will never understand them –
will never even be able to communicate with their minds.

And then – what am I to do with you, the survivors, when your purpose has been fulfilled?
It would be simplest, and perhaps most merciful, to destroy you – as you yourselves would destroy a mortally wounded pet you loved.
But this I cannot do. Your future will be your own to choose in the years that are left to you.
It is my hope that humanity will go to its rest in peace, knowing that it has not lived in vain.
‘For what you will have brought into the world may be utterly alien, it may share none of your desires or hopes,
it may look upon your greatest achievements as childish toys – yet it is something wonderful, and you will have created it.
When our race is forgotten, part of yours will still exist.
Do not, therefore, condemn us for what we were compelled to do.
And remember this – we shall always envy you.

Siempre existirá un número determinado de personas que tenga gran curiosidad por el
desconocido espacio exterior, y un deseo ardiente por escapar de la morada-prisión de lo
conocido y lo real, para deambular por las regiones encantadas llenas de aventuras y
posibilidades infinitas a las que sólo los sueños pueden acercarse:
las profundidades de los bosques añosos, la maravilla de fantásticas torres y las llameantes
y asombrosas puestas de sol.

¿Y si siguiera durmiendo un poco y me olvidara de todas estas chifladuras?

Like many kids, I think, to some degree programming was a refuge from aspects of life that
I couldn't handle.

I can't help myself—I can't keep myself from wanting to do things in
ways that I think are fun and interesting.

Television, radio, and all the sources of amusement and information that surround us in our
daily lives are also artificial props.
They can give us the impression that our minds are active, because we are required to react
to stimuli from outside. But the power of those external stimuli to keep us going is limited.
They are like drugs. We grow used to them, and we continuously need more and more of them.
Eventually, they have little or no effect. Then, if we lack resources within ourselves, we
cease to grow intellectually, morally, and spiritually.
And when we cease to grow, we begin to die.
Reading well, which means reading actively, is thus not only a good in itself, nor is it
merely a means to advancement in our works or career. It also serves to keep our minds
alive and growing.

Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not.

Many things that seem threatening in the dark become welcoming when we shine light on them.

You must look within yourself to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self reveal itself.

You must never give into despair. Allow yourself to slip down that road and you surrender to your lowest instincts.
In the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself. That is the meaning of inner strength.

There are reasons each of us are born. We have to find those reasons.

It's time for you to look inward and start asking yourself the big questions: who are you and what do you want?

Pride is not the opposite of shame but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame.

You have light and peace inside of you. If you let it out, you can change the world around you.

You are not the man you used to be Zuko. You are stronger, and wiser, and freer than you have ever been! And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose.

It is important to draw wisdom from different places. If you take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale.

The true mind can weather all lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart can touch the poison of hatred without being harmed. Since beginningless time, darkness thrives in the void, but always yields to purifying light.

I was never angry with you. I was sad, because I was afraid you'd lost your way.

But I don't want to go among mad people, Alice remarked.
Oh, you can't help that, said the Cat: we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.
How do you know I'm mad? said Alice.
You must be, said the Cat, or you wouldn't have come here.

Alice: Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?
The Cheshire Cat: That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.
Alice: I don't much care where.
The Cheshire Cat: Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.

Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle.

If everybody minded their own business, the world would go around a great deal faster than it does.

Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it

If our reasonings have been correct, it is perfectly possible that there could have existed a race of men who spoke, judged, reasoned, solved problems, indeed did most of the things that we do, but who were not conscious at all. This is the important and in some ways upsetting notion that we are forced to conclude at this point.
Indeed I have begun in this fashion, and place great importance on this opening chapter, for unless you are here convinced that a civilization without consciousness is possible, you will find the discussion that follows unconvincing and paradoxical.

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.

Suddenly, last week, I was walking down the street and upon turning to look at my friend – I heard a plaintive cry: ‘But they're going to paint me yellow!' The scoundrels! Barbarians!

‘The story of my life!' I cried out, frightened. ‘My story! But who told you that I have a story to tell? I don't have a story …' ‘But how have you lived if there's no story?' she interrupted, smiling.

His imagination is once again incited, excited, and suddenly again a new world, a new enchanting life with its glistening vistas flashes before him. A new dream is new happiness! A new dose of exquisite, voluptuous poison! Oh, what does real life have to offer him! In his misdirected view, you and I, Nastenka, live so idly, slowly, sluggishly; in his view, we are all so dissatisfied with our fate, so worn down by our life! And really, as a matter of fact, look how everything at first glance among us is cold, gloomy, indeed wrathful … “The poor things,” my dreamer thinks. And it's no wonder that he should think so! Look at these magical phantoms that so enchantingly, so whimsically, so boundlessly and broadly take shape before him in such a magical, animated picture, in which the most important figure in the foreground, of course, is he himself, our dreamer, his own dear person. Look, what diverse adventures, what an endless swarm of ecstatic daydreams. You will ask, perhaps, what does he dream about?

No, Nastenka, what need has he, this voluptuous sluggard, of this life that you and I desire so? He thinks that this is a poor, pitiful life, not anticipating that perhaps some day the sad hour will strike for him as well, when for a single day of this pitiful life he would give up all of his fantastic years, and give them up not for joy, or for happiness, and without wishing to choose in this hour of sadness, repentance and boundless sorrow. But this terrible time has yet to come – he desires nothing, because he is above desire, because he has everything, because he is sated, because he himself is the artist of his life and he creates it for himself every hour to suit his latest whim. And, you see, this fairy-tale, fantastic world is created so easily, so naturally! As though all this were truly not a phantom! Indeed, he is prepared to believe at certain moments that all of this life is not the excitement of feelings, not a mirage, not a delusion of the imagination, but that it is, indeed, authentic, genuine, real!

You sense that this inexhaustible fantasy is finally growing tired, that it is becoming exhausted under constant strain; because, you see, you are growing into manhood, you are outgrowing your former ideals: they are being smashed to dust, to bits and pieces; and if there is no other life, then you must build it from these bits and pieces. But meanwhile your soul yearns and pleads for something else! And in vain does the dreamer rake through his old dreams, as if they were ashes, searching in these ashes for at least some little spark, in order to fan it into flames, and with this rekindled fire warm his heart, which has grown cold, and resurrect in himself once again everything that he had held dear, that had touched his soul, that had made his blood boil, that had brought tears to his eyes and had so splendidly deceived him! Do you know, Nastenka, how low I have fallen?

At every stage of technique since Daedalus or Hero of Alexandria, the ability of the artificer to produce a working simulacrum of a living organism has always intrigued people. This desire to produce and to study automata has always been expressed in terms of the living technique of the age. In the days of magic, we have the bizarre and sinister concept of the Golem, that figure of clay into which the Rabbi of Prague breathed life with the blasphemy of the Ineffable Name Of God. In the time of Newton, the automaton becomes the clockwork music box, with the little effigies pirouetting stiffly on top. In the nineteenth century, the automaton is a glorified heat engine, burning some combustible fuel instead of the glycogen of the human muscles. Finally, the present automaton open doors by means of photocells, or points guns to the place at which a radar beam picks ups an airplane, or computes the solution of a differential equation.

Time keeps on slipping into the future

True warriors have no reason to be cruel.

Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself.

Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all.

You cannot hide from yourself.

They complain, "control your kids, they're growing up to praise false idols", yes!

But you can learn, you can fight with a will to survive,
Or you can follow on the path of your lifeblood, your peers and your leaders

People are strange when you are stranger

I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to

Compliance
We just need your compliance
You will feel no pain anymore
No more defiance
Just give us your compliance

Life lived in fear, you need protection
You're all alone, too much rejection
We have what you need just reach out and touch
We can save you

Cover your tracks, we know what's best for you
You’ve bitten off much more than you can chew

There are figures on earth that advance how we think and take us higher
But I look up to the clowns, paid crazed and acclaimed and I aspire

Oh George can't you see we're past those golden days?
And nothing stays the same
You better learn to love the hallmarks of your age

Life is a show
Updating my things
I hear myself go
Yeah!
I'm better than you
Yeah!
And this is the truth
I've got 3 statues of myself
And I'm gonna do things my own way

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I'm your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick

Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?

Hold your head up
Keep your head up (Movin' on)
Hold your head up (Movin' on)

First: Since the device is primarily a computer, it will have to perform the elementary operations of arithmetics most frequently. These are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division: +,−,×,÷.
It is therefore reasonable that it should contain specialized organs for just these operations.

Second: The logical control of the device, that is the proper sequencing of its operations can be most eﬃciently carried out by a central control organ.

Third: Any device which is to carry out long and complicated sequences of operations (specifically of calculations) must have a considerable memory.

Fourth: The device must have organs to transfer (numerical or other) information from R into its specific parts, C and M. These organs form its input, the fourth specific part: I.

Fifth: The device must have organs to transfer (presumably only numerical information) from its specific parts C and M into R. These organs form its output, the fifth specific part: O.

No mistakes I know the stakes

And no one thinks they are to blame
Why can't we see?
That when we bleed, we bleed the same

Well, I refuse to let you go

Life will flash before my eyes
So scattered and lost

Don't try to hide it
Don't tell me it's not there

I'ma do, just what I want
Looking ahead, no turning back
People told me, slow my roll
I'm screaming out, fuck that
I'm screaming out, fuck that
I'm screaming out, fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that
Fuck that, fuck that

Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'

Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothin'

You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

Ohh ohh ohh, I guess we'll never know heaven only knows
What we need to know, where we need to go

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven-nation army couldn't hold me back

By the skin of my teeth, by the sweat of my brow
I made it through, but you don't know how
When it's a matter of life or death
I'll drag it out so don't hold your breath

Put me in danger and I feel no fear
Take something from me and I'll shed no tears
I'm self-contained and I got what I need
You have to work hard just to see me bleed

Sliding down on a slippery slope
A ringside seat and you'll earn your robes

I have to confess that I feel no shame
I'm gonna have fun playing out this game

Where's the intelligence that comes with age?
I don't need religion or a self-help sage

You and me are the same, we don't know or care who's to blame

And we know that there's no one we can trust. Our ancient heroes, they are turning to dust

I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe?
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?

This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?

Already pulling me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends

'Cause there's a fire under the altar
I keep on lyin' to, I keep on lyin' to

Don't know why I'm hoping, so fucking naive
Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine

Don't know why I'm hoping for what I won't receive

I'm living for the weekend
I'm screaming like a madman

I'll carry the burden and take the strain

I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles

Hold your breath
And listen

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that

Too young, young
Soulless is everywhere

Destroy the spineless, show me it's real

Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again

So I'll love whatever you become
And forget the reckless things we've done

You
Really believe
We can survive all of this?

We're at death's door
Another world war
Wildfires and earthquakes I foresaw
A life in crisis
Mutated virus
Tsunamis of hate are gonna drown us

True
Just when you think
You are safe and secure
You'll forget what you need to remember
Living in peace
But you're living a lie
The game is rigged

Hole up
Stockpile
Hoard up

When our eyes meet
Time disappears
Turn the clock back
Forget the years

I see it now
Everything that we've been through
Didn't have to end

I'm haunted
You're a ghost from the past
All I want it
Was for things to last

You and I
Were such a beautiful memory

You look a little bit like
Somebody I knew once
Somebody who lost us
Somebody I used to love

Love, it will get you nowhere
You're on your own
Lost in the wild

And ask no questions

Your mind is just a program
And I'm the virus
I'm changing the station

Life burns

Run from what's comfortable. Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious. I have tried prudent planning long enough. From now on I'll be mad.

But I ain't finished
I'm devoted
And you know it
And you know it

They say I'm possessed, it's an omen

We often watch TV to escape and to relax. We do it partly because it’s easy; we don’t have to do anything except change the channel. TV may be beneficial in some ways, but helping us to live a life of significance isn’t one of them.

Karma police
Arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio

For a minute there I lost myself

The passing of traditional beliefs is a dangerous time for any culture.

Caught between unyielding laws of nature and capricious events beyond reckoning, what can we do but go along for the ride? A resigned fatalism seems to be the most rational response to life. In practice this means giving up responsibility, reflection, and choice.

Those who expect priests to be consistently saintly, soldiers brave, mothers always self-sacrificing, and so on, are due for some serious disappointment.

Whereas if one starts from the assumption that humans are basically weak and disoriented creatures thrown by chance into a leading role at the center of the planetary stage, without a script and without rehearsal, then the picture of what we have accomplished is not so bleak.

That something might be inherently wrong with the way the human mind functions has been suggested in many different ways in different historical periods, depending on the symbolic vocabulary of the age.

There is no way to get at reality through words, all generalizations are suspect, and the sharing of meanings between minds is an illusion.

Rational thought works well within the boundaries of rational “games” such as chess, geometry, or calculus, all of which have clear rules and limited assumptions.

The future, however, is not constrained by rules and predictable outcomes. We need to cultivate more than logic if we want to thrive in it. We must foster intuition to anticipate changes before they occur; empathy to understand that which cannot be clearly expressed; wisdom to see the connection between apparently unrelated events; and creativity to discover new ways of defining problems, new rules that will make it possible to adapt to the unexpected.

It is dangerous to take too seriously the picture of the world as painted by one’s culture.

The mere act of watching TV has different consequences for the mind from reading or listening to music, and very different from those that follow on more active forms of leisure. Television the world over seems to have the following effects on viewers: It makes them feel very relaxed, but also significantly less active, alert, mentally focused, satisfied, or creative compared with almost anything else they could be doing. At the same time, in every culture where TV is accessible, people watch it more than they pursue any other activity in their free time. Television is a dramatic example of a meme that invades the mind and reproduces there without concern for the well-being of its host. Like drugs, watching TV initially provides a positive experience.

If we don’t take charge and use them for our own goals, they do have a tendency to take over and use us for their own ends. Of course memes don’t know what their ends are, but most of the time we don’t know what ours are, either.

All major world religions, all synthesizing philosophies, despite the great superficial differences due to accidental historical developments, agree that unless a person learns to control consciousness, he or she cannot achieve harmony with the cosmos, but will forever remain prey to the random forces of biology and society.

Neither excessive humility nor truculent bombast will serve us well in the future.

If there is to be a history, our minds must be prepared to make it.

¿Dónde esta tu honor basura?

This is war with your creator

I guess every superhero needs his theme music

For my theme song

Kill your prayers for love and peace, you’ll wake the thought police

But it should have been right to let our hearts ignite

They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you it's fair

I’m sure I used to be so free

And their necks crane
As they turn to pray for rain

Respect the gods even if they don't come to your aid

When you wake up late every new day looks the same
Who cares? Who dares to try?

Most “I can’ts” are really “I won’ts"

Yo lo siento, pero el flow no está a la venta

Al amanecer, repítete: me voy a encontrar con un entrometido, con un desagradecido, con un soberbio, con un falso, con un envidioso, con un insociable: esas cosas les suceden por su desconocimiento de los bienes y los males. Yo, que he comprendido la naturaleza del bien, que es bella, y la naturaleza del mal, que es fea, y la naturaleza de aquel que yerra, que es mi semejante, no por participar de una sangre y una semilla, sino de un intelecto que es parte de la divinidad, no puedo recibir daño de ninguno de ellos,

Piensa desde cuándo estás dejando esto para más tarde y cuántas veces los dioses te han señalado el plazo y tú lo has dejado pasar. Es necesario ya que te des cuenta de qué mundo eres parte y que eres una emanación de aquello que gobierna el mundo; que tienes un límite de tiempo fijado, que, si no utilizas para apaciguarte, se marchará, y tú también te marcharás, y no habrá una segunda vez.

La tarea es estar recto, no enderezado.

El que prefiere su inteligencia, su genio y los ritos de esta virtud no es un actor trágico, no gime, ni necesita soledad ni muchedumbre. Mejor aún: vivirá sin huir ni perseguir.

Apresúrate hacia el fin, deja a un lado tus vacías esperanzas y, si te preocupas por ti, acude en tu auxilio mientras puedas.

El universo, mutación; la vida, opinión.

Afortunado de mí, porque me ha pasado esto y permanezco libre de pena, sin quebrarme por el presente y sin miedo a lo que venga después.

Al alba, cuando te dé pereza levantarte, ten esto a mano: «Me levanto para una tarea de hombre. Aún me enfado si voy a hacer aquello para lo que he nacido y para lo que he venido al mundo. ¿Es que he sido hecho para esto: para estar tumbado caliente entre mantas?».

¿No te das cuenta de cuántas cosas eres capaz de aportar para las que no hay excusa alguna de falta de facultades naturales o de disposición, pero tú prefieres seguir por debajo de ellas? ¿Acaso te sientes obligado a la queja, la mezquindad, la adulación, a echar las culpas a tu cuerpo, a la vanagloria, a maltratar tu alma porque no estás dotado por naturaleza?

Las cosas por sí mismas no tocan el alma ni lo más mínimo, ni encuentran acceso al alma, ni son capaces de dirigirla ni de moverla: es la propia alma la que se dirige y se mueve a sí misma; según sean las cosas que ella juzgue dignas para sí, así serán los accidentes que produzca en sí misma.

Piensa si hasta el día de hoy te es posible decir eso de: «A nadie hacer ni decir mal». Recuerda por qué cosas has pasado y cuáles has sido capaz de soportar, que la historia de tu vida está ya completa y que tu función ha terminado; cuántas cosas bellas has visto, cuántos placeres y dolores has desdeñado, cuántas vanaglorias has dejado de lado, y ante cuántos insensatos te has mostrado sensato.

Cuando las circunstancias te obliguen a turbarte, repliégate rápido en ti mismo y no rompas tu ritmo más de lo que sea necesario. Serás más dueño de la armonía si no dejas de volver a ella.

En los ejercicios gimnásticos también se reciben arañazos y se dan golpes con la cabeza, pero no protestamos ni nos enfadamos ni sospechamos que nuestro rival vaya a ser en lo sucesivo tramposo; ciertamente nos protegemos, pero no porque sea un enemigo ni por sospechas, sino con una benevolencia esquiva. Que sea así también en los restantes ámbitos de la vida: nos afectan muchas cosas de los que son, por decirlo de algún modo, nuestros compañeros de actividades gimnásticas. Cabe la posibilidad, como decía, de esquivarlos y no sospechar ni enemistarse.

Se hace daño el que permanece en su propio engaño e ignorancia.

Es una vergüenza que, en una vida en la que el cuerpo no desfallece, renuncie el alma.

Recobra la cordura y emplázate a ti mismo, despierta y ten en mente que eran sueños los que te turbaban; vuelve a mirar las cosas despierto, como las mirabas antes.

Acóplate a las cosas que te han tocado en suerte; asimismo, ama a los hombres que el destino te ha puesto delante, pero hazlo de verdad.

Si los dioses han decidido sobre mí y sobre lo que tiene que pasarme, han decidido bien: no cabe concebir a un dios decidiendo mal. ¿Qué le puede impulsar a hacerme mal? ¿Qué podrían sacar de ello para sí mismos o para lo común, que es por lo que miran? ... si no deciden sobre nada de lo que nos atañe, me cabe la posibilidad de decidir sobre mí mismo, pues tengo la capacidad de discernir lo que me conviene. Lo conveniente es lo acorde a la constitución y naturaleza de cada uno

Cuando quieras alegrarte, piensa en las cualidades de los que viven contigo, como, por ejemplo, en la energía de uno, en la discreción de otro, en la generosidad de otro, cada uno con una cosa. Nada da tanta alegría como las imágenes de las virtudes representadas en los caracteres de los que conviven con nosotros y reunidas en la mayor concentración posible. Hay que tenerlas a mano.

¿Acaso tengo la inteligencia suficiente para esto o no? Si es suficiente, me serviré de ella para la acción como de un instrumento que me ha entregado la naturaleza del universo. Si no, o bien me apartaré de la acción en favor de otro que pueda llevarla a cabo mejor, o, si no puede así, lo haré como me sea posible y haré uso de mi principio rector para poner a alguien a mi lado que sea capaz de hacer algo oportuno y útil para la comunidad.

No te alteres por el futuro: llegarás a él, si te es preciso, con la misma razón de la que te sirves para el presente.

Resulta vergonzoso que el rostro sea obediente y se moldee y ordene según mande el pensamiento, pero que este último no se deje moldear y ordenar por sí mismo.

Cava en el interior. En el interior está la fuente del bien, que siempre puede seguir brotando mientras tú sigas cavando.

«Ni insoportable ni eterno»

Es patético no rehuir la maldad propia, siendo posible; pero sí rehuir la ajena, lo que es imposible.

... lucha contra ella el que es conducido a su pesar hacia posiciones contrarias a las verdaderas, pues la naturaleza le ha proporcionado recursos, pero él se ha despreocupado de ellos y no es ya capaz de discernir lo falso de lo verdadero.

Has sufrido un millar de veces por no limitarte a que fuera tu parte rectora la que hiciera esas cosas para las que está constituida: ya basta.

¿Te resulta malo o extraño que un ignorante haga lo propio de un ignorante? Mira bien, porque quizá seas tú el que necesite reproche por no esperar que aquel fuera a obrar mal en eso. Pues tú sí tenías los recursos de la razón suficientes para pensar que era posible que él fuera a obrar mal en eso, pero te olvidaste de ellos, y ahora te asombras de su mala acción.
